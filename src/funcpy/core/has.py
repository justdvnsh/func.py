    The semantics for _has are the following:
    perform a hasOwnProperty call against an object
    of varying types.  This means that
           _has('0', [10]) => true
       _has('1', [10]) => false
       _has('name', {name: 'Arnold'}) => true
       _has('name', instanceFromConstructor) => true
       _has('2', 'the') => true
        To achieve this in python, we perform some
    (potentially) non-exhaustive type checks.

    The catchall at the bottom works for objects at large
    but may be too broad.  Perhaps we should error with certain
    input types.
