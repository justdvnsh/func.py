def _checkForMethod(methodname, fn):
    '''
    this checks whether a function has a
    [methodnamefunction]. If it isn't an array it will execute
    that function otherwise it will defer to ramda.

    _checkForMethod is utilized by functions that operate on arrays
    generally (i.e. forEach, tail, etc).

    Here, we are extending the is_array check to include lists and tuples.
    This method seems generally less intuitive in ramda.js and even
    more so in its translation to Python.
